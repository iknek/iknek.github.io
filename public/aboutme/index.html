        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, raised in Sweden, and educated in international schools, I&rsquo;ve spent my life surrounded by people from all corners of the world. On rare occasions where I’ve not been surrounded by people, I&rsquo;ve been a child of the internet - fascinated by all things related to technology.</p>
<p>At the age of 5, I moved with my parents to England. A year later, we moved to Stockholm, Sweden - a city in which I grew up in, and which is near to my heart. After completing high school, I decided to move to Gothenburg, to start studying at Chalmers.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>Following my middle and high school education at an International Baccalaureate school, I combined my love for academics and technology by pursuing a civilingenjörsutbildning in Informationsteknik (Software Engineering) at <a href="https://chalmers.se/en">Chalmers</a>.</p>
<p>For the fourth year of my education, I started off my Master&rsquo;s degree with a year-long exchange at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/">University of Groningen</a>, in the Netherlands. Now I&rsquo;m back in Sweden, and soon due to start working on my Master&rsquo;s thesis.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>Whilst this site isn&rsquo;t meant to be a CV (you can find that on my LinkedIn), a quick overview feels appropriate. Alongside working as an in-store seller for Inet, I&rsquo;ve also previously been a teacher assistant for a number of courses at Chalmers. I was also the treasurer for ArmIT, the IT student division&rsquo;s corporate relations committee.</p>
<p>Last summer, I worked at <a href="https://tillitis.se">Tillitis</a>, a spin-off company from Mullvad. Whilst it&rsquo;s still very small, Tillitis makes a very interesting USB security key, which is fully open-source. My blog post on the TKey, and working at Tillitis, can be found <a href="https://iknek.github.io/blog/time-at-tillitis/">here</a>.</p>
<p>During my exchange year, I did an internship in conjunction with ASML, for the Software Engineering and Maintenance course at RUG, and then at TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research).</p>
<p>Since returning from the Netherlands, I&rsquo;ve primarily focused on university, but I am also current a student exchange studies ambassador at Chalmers.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p>During the last four years of my education, I&rsquo;ve developed a strong interest in cyber security - both in terms of implementation, and testing. This was in large part spurred on thanks to my bachelor thesis work, which was centred around planning, and executing, a full pen-test of an IoT doorbell camera. And, naturally, my time at Tillitis!</p>
<p>Outside of academics and work, I have built computers since the age of 14, and been an active member on the Swedish tech forum ‘Sweclockers’ since 15. I&rsquo;m also an active member of the fixed gear bike community in Sweden, and currently admin of the Fixed Gear Gothenburg Facebook group. Beyond those interests, I&rsquo;m also highly interested in cars and vintage watches.</p>
<h2 id="what-am-i-up-to-nowadays">What am I up to nowadays?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, I&rsquo;m currently back in Sweden after living in the Netherlands. In my free-time, I&rsquo;ve found myself doing a fair bit of security research, primarily through public bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs. This has been a lot of fun (and very challenging since I&rsquo;m doing everything alone!), as these types of programs have enabled me to dabble with a vast range of different tech stacks/technologies, and tools.</p>
