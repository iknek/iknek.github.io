      <description>&lt;p&gt;For quite a while, I have considered purchasing a server. Like most persons looking into acquiring greatly depreciated enterprise hardware, I’ve conceived many a justification for such a purchase, though ultimately have had to concede that it’s purely for the purpose of tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tackling the Nixu Hacking CTF Challenge</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/nixu-hacking-ctf/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled across the Nixu Corporation’s CTF page, and decided to try my hand at the &amp;lsquo;Hackin&amp;rsquo; challenge.&#xA;Please note that whilst, yes, I am publishing this on a public blog, this page will not be indexed, and the job posting which the CTF was linked from is now gone, so the chance of me ruining the CTF is near non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post dicusses building management systems (BMS), the (horrible) state of their security, and the security impact that these systems can have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, raised in Sweden, and educated in international schools, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent my life surrounded by people from all corners of the world. On rare occasions where I’ve not been surrounded by people, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a child of the internet - fascinated by all things related to technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 5, I moved with my parents to England. A year later, we moved to Stockholm, Sweden - a city in which I grew up in, and which is near to my heart. After completing high school, I decided to move to Gothenburg, to start studying at Chalmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself sitting on Shodan.io, trying out different things and generally exploring the tool. By chance, I ended up finding a Lantronix device, which is where things got interesting!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Erlang, a programming language that was maybe too good for its own sake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>About This Site</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-this-site-for&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s this site for?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site is intended to be my little corner of the internet. Unlike my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/iknek/iknek.github.io.old&#34;&gt;original site&lt;/a&gt;, which was made purely for visitors to learn more about me, this site will hopefully become a space where I can post my thoughts, research, and interesting information. Thus, its goals are twofold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-it-made&#34;&gt;How is it made?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site is made using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, an open source static site generator. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Go, but most of the heavy lifting was already done for me, thanks to the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall&#34;&gt;Nightfall&lt;/a&gt; theme. In the future I hope to change a fair bit of stuff, and really make it my own, but for now I want to focus more on the content, rather than the looks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
