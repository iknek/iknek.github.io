## What's this site for?

This site is intended to be my little corner of the internet. Unlike my [original site](https://github.com/iknek/iknek.github.io), which was made purely for visitors to learn more about me, this site will hopefully become a space where I can post my thoughts, research, and interesting information. Thus, its goals are twofold.

## How is it made?

This site is made using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio), an open source static site generator. It's written in Go, but honestly most of the hard work was already done for me, thanks to the wonderful [Nightfall](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall) theme. In the future I hope to change a fair bit of stuff, and really make it my own, but for now I want to focus more on the content, rather than the looks.
