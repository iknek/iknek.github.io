## Background

Born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, raised in Sweden, and educated in international schools, I've spent my life surrounded by people from all corners of the world. On rare occasions where I’ve not been surrounded by people, I've been a child of the internet - fascinated by all things related to technology.

At the age of 5, I moved with my parents to England. A year later, we moved to Stockholm, Sweden - a city in which I grew up in, and which is near to my heart. After completing high school, I decided to move to Gothenburg, to start studying at Chalmers.

## Education

Following my middle and high school education at an International Baccalaureate school, I combined my love for academics and technology by pursuing a civilingenjörsutbildning in Informationsteknik (Software Engineering) at [Chalmers](https://chalmers.se/en).

For the fourth year of my education, I'll be starting off my Master's degree with an exchange year in the Netherlands, at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/).

## Work

Whilst this site isn't meant to be a CV (you can find that on my LinkedIn), a quick overview feels appropriate. Alongside working as an in-store seller for Inet, I've also been a teacher assistant for a number of courses at Chalmers. I was also the treasurer for ArmIT, the IT division's corporate relations committee.

This summer, I've been working at [Tillitis](https://tillitis.se), a spin-off company from Mullvad. Whilst it's still very small, Tillitis makes a very interesting USB security key, which is fully open-source. My blog post on it can be found [here](https://iknek.github.io/blog/time-at-tillitis/).

## Interests

During the last three years of my education, I've developed a strong interest in cyber security - both in terms of implementation, and testing. This is in large part thanks to my bachelor thesis work, which was centred around planning, and executing, a full pen-test of an IoT doorbell camera. And, naturally, my current job at Tillitis!

Outside of academics and work, I have built computers since the age of 14, and been an active member on the Swedish tech forum ‘Sweclockers’ since 15. At 14, I wrote a guide on ifixit.com which currently has over 55,000 views. I'm also an active member of the fixed gear bike community in Sweden, and currently admin of the Fixed Gear Gothenburg Facebook group.
