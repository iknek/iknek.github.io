## Background

Born in Bosnia and Herzegovina, raised in Sweden, and educated in international schools, I've spent my life surrounded by people from all corners of the world. On rare occasions where I’ve not been surrounded by people, I've been a child of the internet - fascinated by all things related to technology.

At the age of 5, I moved with my parents to England. A year later, we moved to Stockholm, Sweden - a city in which I grew up in, and which is near to my heart. After completing high school, I decided to move to Gothenburg, to start studying at Chalmers.

## Education

Following my middle and high school education at an International Baccalaureate school, I combined my love for academics and technology by pursuing a civilingenjörsutbildning in Informationsteknik (Software Engineering) at [Chalmers](https://chalmers.se/en).

For the fourth year of my education, I started off my Master's degree with a year-long exchange at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), in the Netherlands. Now I'm back in Sweden, and soon due to start working on my Master's thesis.

## Work

Whilst this site isn't meant to be a CV (you can find that on my LinkedIn), a quick overview feels appropriate. Alongside working as an in-store seller for Inet, I've also previously been a teacher assistant for a number of courses at Chalmers. I was also the treasurer for ArmIT, the IT student division's corporate relations committee.

Last summer, I worked at [Tillitis](https://tillitis.se), a spin-off company from Mullvad. Whilst it's still very small, Tillitis makes a very interesting USB security key, which is fully open-source. My blog post on the TKey, and working at Tillitis, can be found [here](https://iknek.github.io/blog/time-at-tillitis/).

During my exchange year, I did an internship in conjunction with ASML, for the Software Engineering and Maintenance course at RUG, and then at TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research).

Since returning from the Netherlands, I've primarily focused on university, but I am also current a student exchange studies ambassador at Chalmers.

## Interests

During the last four years of my education, I've developed a strong interest in cyber security - both in terms of implementation, and testing. This was in large part spurred on thanks to my bachelor thesis work, which was centred around planning, and executing, a full pen-test of an IoT doorbell camera. And, naturally, my time at Tillitis!

Outside of academics and work, I have built computers since the age of 14, and been an active member on the Swedish tech forum ‘Sweclockers’ since 15. I'm also an active member of the fixed gear bike community in Sweden, and currently admin of the Fixed Gear Gothenburg Facebook group. Beyond those interests, I'm also highly interested in cars and vintage watches.

## What am I up to nowadays?

As mentioned, I'm currently back in Sweden from living in the Netherlands. In my free-time, I've found myself doing a fair bit of security research, primarily through public bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs. This has been a lot of fun (and very challenging since I'm doing everything alone!), as these types of programs have enabled me to dabble with a vast range of different tech stacks/technologies, and tools.
